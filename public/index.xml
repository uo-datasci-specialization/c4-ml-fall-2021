      <description>This course includes three labs at 10 points each, a midterm quiz (10 points), a midterm take-home (60 points) and a final project.
A note on deadlines I would like to, as much a possible, stick to the deadlines below so we can go over them together as a group after everyone has submitted their assignment. However, if you need additional time for any reason please just send me a note letting me know.</description>
