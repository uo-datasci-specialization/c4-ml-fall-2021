Welcome to the fourth course in the [Educational Data Science](https://education.uoregon.edu/data-science-specialization-educational-leadership) specialization. 


(*NOTE. Expand this later*)

This course focuses on applied machine learning (ML), with an emphasis on supervised learning methods that have emerged over the last several decades. The primary goal of these methods is to create models capable of making accurate predictions, which generally implies less emphasis on statistical inference.
